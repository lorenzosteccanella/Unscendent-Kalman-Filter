Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./UnscentedKF



## Other Important Dependencies

* cmake >= v3.5
* make >= v4.1
* gcc/g++ >= v5.4

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./UnscentedKF path/to/input.txt path/to/output.txt`. You can find
   some sample inputs in 'data/'.
    - eg. `./UnscentedKF ../data/obj_pose-laser-radar-synthetic-input.txt`
